## FAQ

#### What is a "Legistar"

Legistar is a management system for events made by Granicus. Currently, if you want an API to get data, you have to have a city account. In order to get info into other sources (for example a planner), you could use this api instead. 

#### What are it's required dependencies?

The main dependencies are Jsoup and Selenium. Note, you can connect to a Selenium server in order to get this to work.
